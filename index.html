                            The Standard Test Condition rating (STC) assumes a standard
            set of optimal operating conditions (25&deg;C cell
            temperature, 1000 W/m<sup>2</sup> and an air mass of 1.5).
            The STC rating is most often used by manufacturers to
            classify the power output of PV modules. To calculate the
            system's energy production for any future year, the expected
            degradation in system performance is included (See
            "PV degradation", in table below).                        </div>

            irradiance at the given location. A typical meteorological

            including panel tilt, orientation (azimuth), and system

                            System efficiency is estimated to account for losses caused
            by a variety of factors. These factors include intermittent
            shading, cable losses, dirt, scheduled downtime,
            manufacturer tolerances, inverter efficiency for DC to AC
            (this does not affect off-grid DC only systems), battery

                    The system design may change based on a detailed site audit. Estimated savings are based on past electrical usage and utility rates provided by the customer where applicable. Actual system production and savings will vary based on final system design, configuration, utility rates, applicable subsidies and your energy usage post-solar installation. Utility rates, charges and fee structures imposed by your utility are not affected by this proposal and are subject to change in the future at the discretion of your utility. The production calculations in this report are based on historical climate data for the site location and represent typical estimates of future solar production.

                The Standard Test Condition rating (STC) assumes a standard
            set of optimal operating conditions (25&deg;C cell
            temperature, 1000 W/m<sup>2</sup> and an air mass of 1.5).
            The STC rating is most often used by manufacturers to
            classify the power output of PV modules. To calculate the
            system's energy production for any future year, the expected
            degradation in system performance is included (See
            "PV degradation", in table below).            </div>

                Energy Output is calculated based on historical solar
            irradiance at the given location. A typical meteorological
            year is selected using statistical methods. Factors
            including panel tilt, orientation (azimuth), and system

                System efficiency is estimated to account for losses caused
            by a variety of factors. These factors include intermittent
            shading, cable losses, dirt, scheduled downtime,
            manufacturer tolerances, inverter efficiency for DC to AC
            (this does not affect off-grid DC only systems), battery
